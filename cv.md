## About me

I am 39 y.o. I graduated from BSEU as a marketer in 2010. My first job was as a customer service manager in a printing company. It was here that I learned to communicate with people, finding an approach to everyone personally.I learned to hear people and build trusting and friendly relationships with clients.I work as an accountant with a telecommunications company now. I always wanted to find myself and develop in what I love. So I started learning JS at RSSchool.
